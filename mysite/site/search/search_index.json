Pythagoras Theorem Proof Given: A right-angled triangle ABC, right-angled at B. To Prove- AC2 = AB2 + BC2 Construction: Draw a perpendicular BD meeting AC at D. Pythagoras theorem Proof Proof: We know, \u25b3ADB ~ \u25b3ABC Therefore, (corresponding sides of similar triangles) Or, AB2 = AD \u00d7 AC Also, \u25b3BDC ~\u25b3ABC Therefore,$\\sqrt{2}$: $$ c=\\sqrt{a^2+b^2} $$ (corresponding sides of similar triangles) Or, BC2= CD \u00d7 AC Adding the equations and we get, $ a^2+b^2=c^2 $ AB2 + BC2 = AD \u00d7 AC + CD \u00d7 AC AB2 + BC2 = AC (AD + CD) Since, AD + CD = AC Therefore, AC2 = AB2 + BC2 Hence, the Pythagorean theorem is proved. Note: Pythagorean theorem is only applicable to Right-Angled triangle. Video Lesson on Pythagoras Theorem 39,49,875 To know if the triangle is a right-angled triangle or not. In a right-angled triangle, we can calculate the length of any side if the other two sides are given. To find the diagonal of a square. Useful For Pythagoras theorem is useful to find the sides of a right-angled triangle. If we know the two sides of a right triangle, then we can find the third side. How to use Pythagoras Theorem? To use Pythagoras theorem, remember the formula given below: c2 = a2 + b2 Where a, b and c are the sides of the right triangle. For example, if the sides of a triangles are a, b and c, such that a = 3 cm, b = 4 cm and c is the hypotenuse. Find the value of c. We know, c2 = a2 + b2 c2 = 32+42 c2 = 9+16 c2 = 25 c = \u221a25 c = 5 cm Hence, the length of hypotenuse is 5 cm. How to find whether a triangle is a right-angled triangle? If we are provided with the length of three sides of a triangle, then to find whether the triangle is a right-angled triangle or not, we need to use the Pythagorean theorem. Let us understand this statement with the help of an example. Suppose a triangle with sides 10cm, 24cm, and 26cm are given. Clearly, 26 is the longest side. It also satisfies the condition, 10 + 24 > 26 We know, c2 = a2 + b2 So, let a = 10, b = 24 and c = 26 First we will solve R.H.S. of equation 1. a2 + b2 = 102 + 242 = 100 + 576 = 676 Now, taking L.H.S, we get; c2 = 262 = 676 We can see, LHS = RHS Therefore, the given triangle is a right triangle, as it satisfies the Pythagoras theorem.
